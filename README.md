## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select any item on the menu, edit it, and add it to their order
- If the selected item is a pizza, have editing control over size, crust, sauce, cheese, and an assortment of toppings which can even be split to different sides of the pizza for sharing wih friends
- See a confirmation screen, telling them what they've just added to their cart
- View all of the items in the cart and a subtotal price
- Have the option to delete an item or edit it, both of which will update the cart
